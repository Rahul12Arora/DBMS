Essential theory concepts of DBMS

<h2>Indexes</h2>

**Indexes is a collection of keys from a field in Mongo document that points to the actual document, we create indexes so that we can easily locate & search documents we need based on the value of that key, since we have a separate collection of keys as indexes, we can perform operations like binary search after sorting the index collection, that gives us the advantage of not going through the whole collection in order to find the documents that we need based of that key**
